The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by
Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”， at Sotheby’s in London on September 15th 2008. All but two
pieces sold, fetching more than ￡ 70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer
called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.
The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its
peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research
firm—double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market
generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and
controversy in a way matched by few other industries.
In the weeks and months that followed Mr Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable,
especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the
financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries
and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector—for Chinese
contemporary art—they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two
biggest auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had
placed works for sale with them.
The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the
end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This
time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more
fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”
What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in
the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell.
Christie’s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was
interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack
of good work to sell. The three Ds—death, debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone
who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

Over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors — habits —
among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply
lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.
“There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers
only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private
industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”
The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to — Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever — had invested
hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce
new routines.
If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day — chewing gums, skin
moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth
whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins— are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly
brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many
Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or
one of the other brands.
A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started
bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long.
Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener
and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped
in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer
psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and
other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s
essential to making new products commercially viable.”
Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in
tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged,
controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy
foods.

Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the
principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on
juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no
citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that
defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community
and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than
representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing
representatives to govern for them.
But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states,
for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character.
Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection
as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries
provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first
served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for
jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to
have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at
home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of
democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and
required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975
decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all
parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to
be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.

“Suatainability” has become apopular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal
meaning. Having endured apainful period of unsustainability in his own life made itclear to him that
sustainability-oriented values must be expressed though everyday action and choice 。 Ning recalls spending
aconfusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He’d been though the dot-com boom and burst and,desperate
for ajob,signed on with a Boulder agency。 It didin’t go well. “It was a really had move because that’s not my
passion,” says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. “I was miserable, I
had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and
needed the job. Everyone said, ‘Just wait, you’ll trun the corner, give it some time.’”

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became
president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting
much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation
committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year
Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.
Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made
their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the
chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice
based on having weathered their own crises.
The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than
64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one
proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers
concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise
departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%.
The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform
worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and
subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off
a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.
But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations
if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time
any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create
incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on
campus.

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened
to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco
Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America’s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about
how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them ? It will
hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.
In much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession.
Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global industry, have not only survived
but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.
It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society
of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer
products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures
have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.
Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and
advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues
came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD).
In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.
The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been
concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science
and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a
result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with
soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.
But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more.
During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination
with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.
Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase “less is more” was
actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated
with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II
and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on
the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies.
Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. Elegance,
he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and
laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s
sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big
and often empty.
The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, for example, were
smaller-two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along the city’s Gold
Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the
buildings’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.
The trend toward “less” was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more
modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading two-story ones he had designed
in the 1890s and the early 20th century.
The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture
magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic
effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everyday
life - few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers - but his belief that
self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the
303
project’s greatest cheerleaders talk of a continent facing a “Bermuda triangle” of debt, population decline and
lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU face an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use
the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone’s economies, weaker or stronger, will one day
converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix
of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe’s single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the
euro zone’s dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro
zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrow spending and competitiveness, barked by
quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for
poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country’s voting rights in EU ministerial
councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there
is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigour; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small
majority favour French interference.
A “southern” camp headed by French wants something different: ”European economic government” within
an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a
system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common
Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, curo-zone
members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or
labour costs.
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world’s largest trading block. At its best, the European project
is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more
open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the
sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism benign.

Leading doctors today weigh in on the debate over the government's role in promoting publie health by
304
demanding that ministers impose "fat taxes"on unhealthy food and introduce cigarette-style wamings to children
about the dangers of a poor diet。
The demands follow comments made last week by the health secretary Andrew Lansley, who insisted the
government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health
regulations。
But senior medical figures want to stop fast-food outlets opening near schools. restrict advertising of
products high in fat, salt or sugar, and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast-food producers such as
Medonald's.
They argue that government action is necessary to curb Britains addiction to unhealthy food and help halt
spiraling rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College
of Paediatrics and Child Health, said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as
damaging as smoking or excessive drinking.
Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the workplace or in
pubs, and yet that is what we have now. Are we wiling to be just as courageous in respect of obesity? 1 would
suggest that we should be, said the leader of the Uks childrens doctors.
Lansley has alarmed health campaigners by suggesting he wants industry rather than government to take the
lead. He said that manufacturers of crisps and candies could play a central role in the Change4life campaign, the
centrepiece of government efforts to boost healthy eating and fitness. He has also criticised the celebrity chef
Jamie Olivers high-profile attempt to improve school lunches in England as an example of how"lecturing"people
was not the best way to change their behaviour。
Stephenson suggested potential restrictions could include banning TV advertisements for foods high in fat,
salt or sugar before 9 pm and limiting them on billboards or in cinemas. "If we were really bold, we might even
begin to think of high-calorie fast food in the same way as cigarettes-by serting strict limits on advertising, product
placement and sponsorship of sports events, "he said.
Such a move could affect firms such as McDonald’s, which sponsors the youth coaching scheme run by the
Football Association. Fast-food chains should also stop offering “inducements” such as toys, cute animals and
mobile phone credit to lure young customers, Stephenson said.
Professor Dinesh Bhugra, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “If children are taught about
the impact that food has on their growth, and that some things can harm, at least information is available up
front.”
He also urged councils to impose “fast-food-free zones” around school and hospitals-areas within which
takeaways cannot open.
A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We need to create a new vision for public health where all of
society works together to get healthy and live longer. This includes creating a new ‘responsibility deal’ with
business, built on social responsibility, not state regulation. Later this year, we will publish a white paper setting
out exactly how we will achieve this.”
The food industry will be alarmed that such senior doctors back such radical moves, especially the call to use
some of the tough tactics that have been deployed against smoking over the last decade.

Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent years it has
been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their
thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates
that with the exception of some advanced courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a
student’s academic grade.
This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in
completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be
assigned that students cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to
students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the
implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.
District administrators say that homework will still be a pat of schooling: teachers are allowed to assign as
much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily
skip half their homework and see vey little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state
tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their
homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works
best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.
At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If the district finds
homework to be unimportant to its students’ academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the
assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework does nothing to ensure that the
homework students are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.
The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for setting educational
policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework right.

Pretty in pink: adult women do not rememer being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young
girls’ lives. Tt is not that pink is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tiny slice of the rainbow and, though it may
celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girls’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that
connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking
around, I despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls’ lives and interests.
Girls’ attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti,
an associate professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th
309
century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only
way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What’s more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as
gender-neutral dresses.When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine
colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary,
constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex
differences became a dominant children’s marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, when it began to
seem inherently attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.
I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kins,
including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I assumed that phase was
something experts developed after years of research into children’s behaviour: wrong. Turns out, acdording to
Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularised as a marketing trick by clothing
manufacrurers in the 1930s.
Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should create a “third
stepping stone” between infant wear and older kids’ clothes. Tt was only after “toddler”became a common
shoppers’ term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults,into ever-tinier
categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to
magnify gender differences – or invent them where they did not previously exist.

In 2010. a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won patents for isolated
DNA for decades-by 2005 some 20% of human genes were parented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes
were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO)， a trade
group， assured members that this was just a “preliminary step” in a longer battle.
On July 29th they were relieved， at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision，
ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed holb patents to two genss that help forecast a woman's risk of breast
cancer. The chief executive of Myriad， a company in Utah， said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients
alike.
But as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine， the courts will remain rather busy. The
Myriad case itself is probably not over Critics make three main arguments against gene patents ： a gene is a
product of nature， so it may not be patented； gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it； and patents'
monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree.Last year a federal
310
task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the
Myriad case， arguing that an isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres that
have been separated from cotton seeds. ”
Despite the appeals court's decision， big questions remain unanswered. For example， it is unclear whether
the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of indivi dual genes within it. The case may yet reach the
Supreme Court.
AS the industry advances ,however,other suits may have an even greater impact.companies are unlikely to file
many more patents for human DNA molecules-most are already patented or in the public domain .firms are now
studying how genes intcract,looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or
predict a drug’s efficacy,companies are eager to win patents for ‘connecting the dits’,expaains hans sauer,alawyer
for the BIO.
Their success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the
Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO rtcently held a convention which included seddions to coach
lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was packed.

The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends,
it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to
reshape our politics,our culture, and the character of our society for years.
No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that
unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they had become less materialistic and
more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession
will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and
bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.
But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of
Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S. ,lengthy
periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive,
and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically
increases, as does conflict between races and classes.
Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one,. Indeed, this period of
economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them--- especially for young
people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia University, suggests that not all people
graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly
quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath
them that are left behind.
In the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden winthin American
society. More difficult, in the moment , is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society’s character.
In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this resession than at any time in its history, and a
variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see
311
exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly it, and all the more so the longer they
extend.

“Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of
the Great Men who have worked here,” wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well, not any more it is not.
Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more than a
passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with
learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.
From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great
men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus – On Famous Men, highlighting the
virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top.
This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, the championed
cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.
Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors
of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the
Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers , industrialists and
explores . "The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, if patient purpose, resolute working
and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formulation of truly noble and many character, exhibit,"wrote Smiles."what it
is in the power of each to accomplish for himself"His biographies of James Walt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah
Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.
This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of
Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate,
but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals.
Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles:“It is
man, real, living man who does all that.” And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle.
As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch
stood. For:“Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under
circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.”
This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain
nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of
312
great men. Whole new realms of understanding — from gender to race to cultural studies — were opened up as
scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as
fascinating as upstairs.

Dear Sir or Madame,
As one of the regular customers of your online store, I am writing this letter to express my complaint against the
flaws in your product—an electronic dictionary I bought in your shop the other day.
The dictionary is supposed to be a favorable tool for my study. Unfortunately, I found that there are several
problems. To begin with, when I opened it, I detected that the appearance of it had been scratched. Secondly, I did
not find the battery promised in the advertisement posted on the homepage of your shop, which makes me feel that
you have not kept your promise. What is worse, some of the keys on the keyboard do not work.
I strongly request that a satisfactory explanation be given and effective measures should be taken to improve your
service and the quality of your products. You can either send a new one to me or refund me my money in full.
I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely yours,
Zhang Wei

The table above revealed an overall picture of employment satisfaction. Based upon the data of the table, most
people under 40 are unclear or dissatisfied with their job, and 64% of those between 40 to 50, are not satisfied and
no one feel satisfied at all. For people over 50, the degree of satisfaction largely exceeds the other groups,
amounting to 40%.
Such difference may be rooted in the following reasons. First, middle-aged people face more pressure to support
the family, both the children and the senior, so that they neglect to enjoy in work. Second, the senior citizens has
developed a lot in personality, so they are more prone to see the optimistic aspects of the work. Last, the conclusion
that the current society patterns pose more challenges to the middle aged group under 50.
To sum up, the senior citizens enjoys more content than the young and middle-aged people under 50.

In an essay entitled “ Making It in America” , the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about just how
much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,” a man and a dog.
The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.”
Davidson’ s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason
we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also because of the
advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever
replacing labor with machines or foreign worker.
In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job ， could earn an average
lifestyle ,But ,today ,average is officially over. Being average just won’ t earn you what it used to. It can’ t when so
many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap
robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra-their
unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.
Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’ s been an acceleration. As
Davidson notes,” In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all
the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs-about 6 million in total
-disappeared.
There will always be changed-new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is
that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and
315
better education to make themselves above average.
In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but
nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I.Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every
American has access to poet-high school education.

A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic inclued settlers and sojourners. Along with the many
folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7millin
people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian immigrants, for exanmle, eventually
returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, “uccelli di passaggio,” birds of passage.
Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide nemcomers into two categories: legal or illegal,
good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or our broken immigrantion system and the long political
paralysis over how to fix it. We don ’ t need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about
categories. We need to look beyond strick definitions of legal and illegal. To start, we can recognize the new birds
of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.
Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists
are among today’ s birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of
work, money and ideas .They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them , They can manage to have a job in
one place and a family in another.
With or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to
imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to
staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations
honorably.
Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the
immigration battle .Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground
and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes. Including
some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.

Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about
how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.
Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our
brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other
factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It
takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like neuroticism or open-mindedness.
But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren’ t exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists at the
University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent
faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and
impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we’ re doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also
tend to think a musical piece lasts too long.
Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options
when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can
take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants,
we can help screeners understand their biases-or hire outside screeners.
John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only after we
ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a
couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a muck longer evaluation; two days, not two
seconds.
Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: doge can think
about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our
days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the way we react, it hasn’ t changed our
nature. We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.

Europe is not a gender-equality heaven.In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family
—friendly until women are part of senior management decisions,and Europe,s top corporate-governance positions
remain overwhelmingly male .indeed,women hold only 14 percent of positions on Europe corporate boards.
The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion
of women-up to 60 percent.This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe Commission Vice
President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender
balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies
took it up.
Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance
work and family?
“Personally, I don’ t like quotas,” Reding said recently. “But i like what the quotas do.” Quotas get action:
they “ open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,” according to Reding, a result seen in
France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.
I understand Reding’ s reluctance-and her frustration. I don’ t like quotas either; they run counter to my belief
in meritocracy, government by the capable. Bur, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic
ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.
After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the
meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position— no matter how much “soft pressure ” is put upon
them. When women do break through to the summit of corporate power--as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently
did at Facebook—they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.
If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women---whether CEOs or their children ’ s
caregivers--and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living
in a more just society.

The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his love of good food with living on
benefits. After bills, Tony has ?60 a week to spend, ?40 of which goes on food, but 10 years ago he was
earning ?130,000 a I year working in corporate communications and eating at London's betft restaurants'" at least
twice a week. Then his marriage failed, his career burned out and his drinking became serious. "The community
mental health team saved my life. And I felt like that again, to a certain degree, when people responded to the blog
so well. It gave me the validation and confidence that I'd lost. But it's still a day-by-day thing." Now he's living in a

eating as cheaply as you can - "there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely any money to spend on
food" - but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies.
41._____________________
Impulsive spending isn't an option, so plan your week's menu in advance, making shopping lists for your
ingredients in their exact quantities. I have an Excel template for a week of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stop
laughing: it's not just cost effective but helps you balance your diet. It's also a good idea to shop daily instead of
weekly, because, being-human, you'll sometimes change your mind about what you fancy.
42____________________________________________________________
This is where supermarkets and thci; anonymity come in handy. With them, there's not the same
embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little greengrocer. And if you plan properly, you'll know that you
only need, say, 350g of shin of beef and six rashers of bacon, not whatever weight is pre-packed in the supermarket
chiller.

You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas in the freezer - that's not good enough. Mine is filled with
leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. Planning ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables
you'll do a vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to "go off' will be cooked or juiced.
44___________________________________
Everyone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers, delis and fish-sellers regularly,
even for small things, and be super friendly. Soon you'll feel comfortable asking if they've any knuckles of ham for
soups and stews, or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads for stock which, more often than not, Theyil let

What would you do with 590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who
recently emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in
history. If she hopes her new-found for tune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read
Happy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton.
These two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend
money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes.
Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once exciting and new becomes
old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton, like
interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with
time-as stories or memories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.
This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness
bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend
more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a
whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more
pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly.
This is apparently the reason MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - a marketing trick that has
turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.
Readers of“HappyMoney” are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger.Money may not
quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link
between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world,
and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors’
policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers.
But most people will come away from this book believing it was money well spent.

An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually, you think you’ re
more beautiful than you are. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a
number of self-enhancing strategies to research into what the call the “ above average effect” , or “ illusory
superiority” , and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving
and 85% at getting on well with others—all obviously statistical impossibilities.
323
We rose tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become defensive when
criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem, we stalk around thinking we’ re hot
stuff.
Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into self-enhancement and
attractiveness. Rather that have people simply rate their beauty compress with others, he asked them to identify an
original photogragh of themselves’ from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less
attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is “ an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and
intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation”. If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering imagewhich must did- they genuinely believed it was really how they looked. Epley found no significant gender
difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that, those who self-enhance the must (that is, the participants
who thought the most positively doctored picture were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In
fact those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those
who showed other makers for having higher self-esteem. “ I don’ t think the findings that we having have are any
evidence of personal delusion” , says Epley. “ It ’ s a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of
themselves’ . If you are depressed, you won’ t be self-enhancing. Knowing the results of Epley ‘ s study,it makes
sense that why people heat photographs of themselves Viscerally-on one level, they don’ t even recognise the
person in the picture as themselves, Facebook therefore ,is a self-enhancer’ s paradise,where people can share only
the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit ,style ,beauty, intellect and lifestyle it’ s not that people’ s profiles
are dishonest,says catalina toma of Wiscon — Madison university , ” but they portray an idealized version of

Crying is hardly an activity encouraged by society. Tears, be they of sorrow, anger, on joy, typically make
Americans feel uncomforuble and embarrassed. The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even when a devastating
(毁灭性的) tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to
the emotional outpouring. But judging form recent studies of crying behavior, links between illness and crying and
the chemical composition of tears, both those responses to tears are often inappropriate and may even be
counterproductive.
Humans are the only animals definitely known to shed emotional tears. Since evolution has given rise to few,
if any, purposeless physiological responset, it is logical to assume that crying has one or more functions that
enhance survival.
324
Although some observers have suggested that crying is a way to clicit assistance form others (as a crying baby
might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries would have been quite
enough, more likely than tears to gain attention, So, it appears, there must be something special about tears
themselves.
Indeed, the new studies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress, University of
Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently isolated two important
chemicals from emotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that are shed in response to emotion. Tears
shed because of exposure to =cut onion would contain no such substance.
Researchers at several other institutions are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing
human ills and monitoring drugs.
At Tulane University’ s Teat Analysis Laboratory Dr.Peter Kastl and his colleagues report that they can use
tears to detect drug abuse and exposure to medication(药物), to determine whether a contact lens fits properly of
why it may be uncomfortable, to study the causes of “ dry eye” syndrome and the effects of eye surgery, and
perhaps even to measure exposure to environmental pollutants.
At Columbia University Dt.Liasy Faris and colleagues are studying tears for clues to the diagnosis of diseases
away from the eyes. Tears can be obtained painlessly without invading the body and only tiny amounts are needed
to perform highly refined analyses.

When the government talks about infrastructure contributing to the economy the focus is usually on roads,
railways, broadband and energy. Housing is seldom mentioned.
Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at
communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical
housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable
that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so
politically charged.
Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time and we are
simply not building enough new homes.
The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to
put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.
There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has
hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the
325
amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new
homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.
Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a
significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.
But it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must
face up to the fact that the existing £4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in
2015,is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part
of the coalition’ s spending plans if returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely
to ever return to era of large-scale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.

A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys, people are actually more stressed at home than at work.
Researchers measured people’s cortisol, which is a stress marker, while they were at work and while they were at
home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.
“Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress
at work than at home,” writes one of the researchers, Sarah Damaske. In fact women say they feel better at work.
She notes. “It is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work.” Another surprise is that the
findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why people who
work outside the home have better health.
What the study doesn’t measure is whether people are still doing work when they’ re at home, whether it is
household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick
back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home,
they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front
lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women, it’s not surprising that women are more
stressed at home.
But it’s not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what they’re supposed to be doing: working,
making money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure. Employee
puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.
On the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor
is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most
of them. Your home colleagues—your family—have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it,
or if they’re teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they’re your family. You
cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.
So it’s not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the tasks apparently infinite, the
co-workers are much harder to motivate.

For years, studies have found that first-generation college students—those who do not have a parent with a
college degree—lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their
dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher
education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created “a paradox”
in that recruiting first-generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has
“continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close” an achievement gap based on social class, according to the
depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science.
But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an
approach (which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap
(measured by such factors as grades) between first-generation and other students.
The authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findings are based on a study involving 147
students (who completed the project) at an unnamed private university. First generation was defined as not having a
parent with a four-year college degree. Most of the first-generation students (59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell
Grants, a federal grant for undergraduates with financial need, while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the
students with at least one parent with a four-year degree.
Their thesis—that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact—was based on the view that
first-generation students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the
issues that face most college students. They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that
must be narrowed to close the achievement gap.
Many first-generation students “struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education， learn the
‘rules of the game,’ and take advantage of college resources,” they write. And this becomes more of a problem
when colleges don’t talk about the class advantage and disadvantages of different groups of students. “Because US
colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students’ educational experience, many
first-generation students lack insight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students ‘like them’
can improve.”

Even in traditional offices, “the lingua franca of corporate America has gotten much more emotional and much
more right-brained than it was 20 years ago,” said Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn. She started
spinning off examples. “If you and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990, we would see much less
frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals， there were strategies, there were objectives,
but we didn’t talk about energy; we didn’t talk about passion.”
330
Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very “team”-oriented—and not by coincidence.
“Let’s not forget sports—in male-dominated corporate America, it’s still a big deal. It’s not explicitly conscious; it’s
the idea that I’m a coach, and you’re my team, and we’re in this together. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very
different companies, but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win”.
These terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning—and, as Khurana points out， increase allegiance
to the firm. “You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit
organizations and religious organizations： Terms like vision, values, passion, and purpose,” said Khurana.
This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates
over work-life balance The “mommy wars” of the 1990s are still going on today, prompting arguments about why
women still can’t have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In， whose title has become a buzzword in its
own right. Terms like unplug, offline, life-hack， bandwidth, and capacity are all about setting boundaries between
the office and the home. But if your work is your “passion,” you’ll be more likely to devote yourself to it, even if
that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed.
But this seems to be the irony of office speak: Everyone makes fun of it, but managers love it, companies
depend on it, and regular people willingly absorb it. As Nunberg said, “You can get people to think it’s nonsense at
the same time that you buy into it.” In a workplace that’s fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning,
office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work—and how your work defines who you are.

Many people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reported for Jure, along with the drop in
the unemployment rate to 6.1 percent, as good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is
creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are
now finally moving forward at a faster pace.
However, there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked. There was a big jump
in the number of people who report voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000 (4.4 percent) above
its year ago level.
Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people
who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An
increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people
will be having a very hard time making ends meet.
There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary
part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000 (7.9 percent) from its
year ago level.
We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The
survey used by the Labor Department asks people if they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the
answer is “yes,” they are classified as working part-time. The survey then asks whether they worked less than 35
hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice. They are only
classified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.
The issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people
to get insurance outside of employment. For many people, especially those with serious health conditions or family
members with serious health conditions, before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that
provided health insurance.
However, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the
331
exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in
order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and
insurance.

Some Old Truths to Help You Overcome Tough Times
Unfortunately, life is not a bed of roses. We are going through life facing sad experiences. Moreover, we are
grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a romantic relationship or a house. Hard times may hold you down at
what usually seems like the most inopportune time, but you should remember that they won’t last forever.
When our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for
life. Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and
happiness. I want to share these old truths I’ve learned along the way.
41.____________________________________
Fear is both useful and harmful. This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and
preparing us to deal with it. Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. My
favorite actor Will Smith once said, “Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand
me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.” I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant
imagination.
42. ____________________________________
If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment.
Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future. You may feel guilt over your past, but you
are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change. Value the present moment and
remember how fortunate you are to be alive. Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see
the possibilities before you. Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that
can be designed into the present.
43. ____________________________________
Sometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. You can be easily caught up by
life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. Only strong people prefer to smile and
value their life instead of crying and complaining about something.
44. ____________________________________
332
No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remember that you
are not alone. Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a
good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people. You may have a circle of friends who provide
constant good humor, help and companionship. If you have no friends or relatives, try to participate in several
online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement.
45. ____________________________________
Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from
external sources. This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life.
When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your
decision is the best. You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own
choices.

Think about driving a route that’s very familiar. It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way
home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it’s easy to
lose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you
perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.
This is the well-travelled road effect: People tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.
The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because
we don’t have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back
on it, we can’t remember the journey well because we didn’t pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter.

It’s true that high-school coding classes aren’t essential for learning computer science in college. Students
without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie
Mellon’s School of Computer Science.
However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn
that it’s not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers — but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or
test hypotheses. It’s not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking
down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this
training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.
Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory
computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students
away.
The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps
that’s become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but “we
try to gear lessons toward things they’re interested in,” said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of
the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.
The students in the Flatiron class probably won’t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook.
Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the “Ruby on Rails” language they learned may not even be
relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn — how to think logically through a
problem and
organize the results — apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state
of North Carolina.
Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole
purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers — in their pockets, in their offices,
in their homes — for the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax the machine
into producing what they want — the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that — the better.

Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens---a kind of bird living on stretching
grasslands—once lent red to the often gray landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just
some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species’ historic range.
The crash was a major reason the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service （ USFWS） decided to formally list the bird as
threatened. “The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation,” said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some
environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as
“endangered,” a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats. But Ashe and
others argued that the“threatened” tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less
confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western
state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action and with the private landowners who control an
estimated 95% of the prairie chicken’s habitat.
Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that
unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range—wide management plan to
restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses
that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new
acres of suitable habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat, USFWS also
set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10
years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies,
the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let “states” remain in the driver’s seat for managing the
species， ” Ashe said.
Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a
dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court Not
surprisingly, doesn’t go far enough “The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the
same industries that are pushing it to extinction,” says biologist Jay Lininger.

That everyone’s too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully：
There’s never any time to read.
What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don’t seem sufficient. The
web’s full of articles offering tips on making time to read: “Give up TV” or “Carry a book with you at all times”
But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn’t work. Sit down to read and the
flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you’re so exhausted that a challenging book’s the last
thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, “is overwhelmingly inclined toward
communication…It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption”. Deep
reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can’t be obtained merely by becoming more
efficient.
In fact, “becoming more efficient” is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised
means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances
progress toward some goal immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency,
goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you’ll manage only goal-focused
reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. “The future comes at us like empty bottles along an
unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,” writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and “we feel a
pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes） as they pass, for if they get by without being
filled, we will have wasted them”. No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.
So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You’d think this might fuel the
efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us “step outside time’s flow” into
“soul time”. You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. “Carry a
book with you at all times” can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the
default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really
good day, it no longer feels as if you’re “making time to read,” but just reading, and making time for everything
else.

Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing
a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.
Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a
successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while
young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different
paths for reaching it.
Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal
fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor
communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure
before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working
outside the home, the survey found.
From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great
Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread
through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.
Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is
harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are
somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in
both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher a good-paying job, starting a family,
managing debt, and finding affordable housing.
Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-yaear-old auto technician from the
Chicago suburbs says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily,
he said.” I can’t afford to pay ma monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people
to mark that happen.” Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children
even though neither had completed college when he was young. “I still grew up in an upper middle-class home
with parents who didn’t have college degrees,” Schneider said. “I don’t think people are capable of that anymore.”

As adults,it seems that we are constantly pursuing happiness,often with mixed results.Yet
children appear to have it down to an art-and for the most part they don't need self-help books or
therapy.instead,they look after their wellbeing instinctively,and usually more effectively than we do
as grownups.Perhaps it's time to learn a few lessons from them.
41.______________
What does a child do when he's sad? He cries.When he's angry?He shouts.Scared?Probably a
bit of both.As we grow up,we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don't
dictate our behaviours,which is in many ways a good thing.But too often we take this process too far
and end up suppressing emotions,especially negative ones.that's about as effective as brushing dirt
under a carpet and can even make us ill.What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and
express what we feel appropriately, and then-again like children-move.
42.____________
A couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was nine years old at the time,
got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed, and couldn't
stop talking about it.Too often we believe that a new job,bigger house or better car will be the
magic silver bullet that will allow us to finally be content,but the reality is these things have very
little lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day is a
much better way to improve wellbeing.
43.______________________
Have you ever noticed how much children laugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness
and giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies , increase good hormones like
endorphins, improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off
enfection. All of which, of course, have a positive effect on happiness levels.
44.__________________
The problem with being a grown up is that there's an awful lot of serious stuff to deal
with---work,mortgage payments,figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the
luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it's important that we schedule in time to enjoy
the things we love.Those things might be social,sporting,creative or completely random(dancing
aroud the living room,anyone?)--it doesn't matter,so long as they're enjoyable, and not likely to
have negative side effects,such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if
you're on a tight budget.
45.___________________
341
Having said all of the above, it's important to add that we shouldn't try too hard to be
happy.Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As
the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said:"Happiness is the absence of striving
for happiness."And in that,once more,we need to look to the example of our children,to whom
happiness is not a goal but a natural by product of the way they live.

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its
doors. The reason for this is simple:The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you'll see, and the
more stuff you see, the more you'll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average
supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,00 different items, and
many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers
into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much
decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people
stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally - which is the point
at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.

Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their
local park. The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the
UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four
years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley's world record 13 minutes 48
seconds up to an hour.
Parkrun is succeeding where London's Olympic "legacy" is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it
was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents
pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from
their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not
happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run－ up to
2012－ but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an
accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a
week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections
continue as to why London 2012 failed to "inspire a generation." The success of Parkrun offers
answers.
Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes
anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is
about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports
and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking
part was intimidating for newcomers.
Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a
fundamentally "grassroots", concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for
345
government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods－ making sure there is
space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the
provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling
green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education.
Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions
for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.

With so much focus on children’s use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own
screen use. “Tech is designed to really suck on you in,” says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play,
"and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage, and
leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.”
Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child
pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who sued devices during the exercise started
20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a
separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would
be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.
Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces
are blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed in a device－ it can be extremely
disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment” devised by developmental
psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal
346
way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child
becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother’s attention. "Parents don't have
to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be
responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says
Radesky.
On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are
born out of an “oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting” with
their children: “It’s based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology
that says if you’re failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.” Tronick
believes that just because a child isn’t learning from the screen doesn’t mean there’s no value to it
－ particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from
their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some
work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their
child the rest of the time.

Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly
high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the
possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems
silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to
spend a year doing something that isn’t academic.
But while this may be true, it’s not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's
347
always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated “race to the finish
line,” whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite
common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits－ in fact, it
probably enhances it.
Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are
generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than
pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new
responsibilities and environmental changes－ all things that first-year students often struggle with
the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being
thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather
than acclimation blunders.
If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then
consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for
Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least
once. This isn’t surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students
with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications, but
switching to another after taking college classes. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on
the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston
College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing
school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent
stress and save money later on.

Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a
national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist
in fire ecology and management.
In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual
budget fighting fires－ nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect,
fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work－ such as forest conservation,
watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep－ that affect the lives of
all Americans.
Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into
construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes
that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?
“It’ s already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,” he
says. We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, “Wait a minute, is this OK?”“Do we want
instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?”
Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire,
researchers say.
For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade,
the focus has been on climate change－ how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is
leading to conditions that worsen fires.
While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the rest of the
equation.
“The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both
ways," he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to "an overly simplified view of what the
solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very
limited.”
At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled
and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But
acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws,
policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.
“We’ve disconnected ourselves from living with fire,” Balch says. “It is really important to
understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.”

The decline in American manufacturing is a common refrain, particularly from Donald Trump. "We
don't make anything anymore," he told Fox News, while defending his own made-in-Mexico clothing
line.
Without question, manufacturing has taken a significant hit during recent decades, and further
trade deals raise questions about whether new shocks could hit manufacturing.
But there is also a different way to look at the data.
Across the country, factory owners are now grappling with a new challenge: instead of having too
many workers, they may end up with too few. Despite trade competition and outsourcing, American
manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers every years. Millennials
may not be that interested in taking their place, other industries are recruiting them with similar or
better pay.
For factory owners, it all adds up to stiff competition for workers－ and upward pressure on wages.
"They're harder to find and they have job offers," says Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil
Spring, a family-owned firm, "They may be coming [into the workforce], but they've been plucked
by other industries that are also doing an well as manufacturing," Mr. Dunwell has begun bringing
high school juniors to the factory so they can get exposed to its culture.
At RoMan Manufacturing, a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment that his father
cofounded in 1980, Robert Roth keep a close eye on the age of his nearly 200 workers, five are
retiring this year. Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement
program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years.
At a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist looks flustered by the copper
coils he's trying to assemble and the arrival of two visitors. It's his first week on the job. Asked about
his choice of career, he says at high school he considered medical school before switching to
electrical engineering. "I love working with tools. I love creating." he says.
But to win over these young workers, manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle: parents,
who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression, telling them to
avoid the factory. Millennials "remember their father and mother both were laid off. They blame it
on the manufacturing recession," says Birgit Klohs, chief executive of The Right Place, a business
development agency for western Michigan.
These concerns aren't misplaced: Employment in manufacturing has fallen from 17 million in 1970
350
to 12 million in 2013. When the recovery began, worker shortages first appeared in the high-skilled
trades. Now shortages are appearing at the mid-skill levels.
"The gap is between the jobs that take to skills and those that require a lot of skill," says Rob Spohr,
a business professor at Montcalm Community College. "There're enough people to fill the jobs at
McDonalds and other places where you don't need to have much skill. It's that gap in between, and
that's where the problem is."
Julie Parks of Grand Rapids Community points to another key to luring Millennials into
manufacturing: a work/life balance. While their parents were content to work long hours, young
people value flexibility. "Overtime is not attractive to this generation. They really want to live their
lives," she says.

engineering because he loves working with
My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing. Two years before
graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion

I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. But,
to be absolutely honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream - I knew that no
one, apart from myself, could imagine me in the fashion industry at all!

But the headlong push into bachelor’s degrees for all—and the subtle devaluing of anything
less—misses an important point: That’s not the only thing the American economy needs. Yes, a
bachelor’s degree opens more doors. But even now,54 percent of the jobs in the country are
middle-skill jobs, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. But only 44 percent of workers
are adequately trained.
In other words, at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head,
frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing, one obvious solution is staring
us in the face. There is a gap in working-class jobs, but the workers who need those jobs most aren’t
equipped to do them. Koziatek’s Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that
gap.
Koziatek’s school is a wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, it risks
overlooking a nation’s diversity of gifts.

While fossil fuels—coal， oil， gas—still generate roughly 85 percent of the world’s energy supply,
357
it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to
renewables is picking up momentum around the world： They now account for more than half of new
power sources going on line.
Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund
cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables，
especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind
turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.
In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland，
for example， wind
turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world
takes the lead， notably China and Europe， the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In
March， for the first time， wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power
generated in the US， reported the US Energy Information Administration.
President Trump has underlined fossil fuels—especially coal—as the path to economic growth.
In a recent speech in Iowa， he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message
did not play well with many in Iowa， where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the
state’s electricity generation—and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the
availability of clean energy to power their data centers.
The question“ what happens when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine?” has provided
a quick
put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to
keep power flowing around the clock more likely.
The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers ， who are placing big bets on
battery-powered electric
vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could
change the picture rapidly in coming years.
While there’s a long way to go， the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The pace of change in
energy sources
appears to be speeding up—perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in slowing climate
change. What Washington does—or doesn’t do—to promote alternative energy may mean less and
less at a time of a global shift in thought.

The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is astonishing—Amazon has just
announced the purchase of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods for$13.5bn， but two years ago
Facebook paid even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service， which doesn’t have
any physical product at all. What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed
web of its users’ friendships and social lives.
Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to
Facebook identities， but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through. Even without
knowing what was in the messages， the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously
revealing and still could be. What political journalist， what party whip， would not want to know the
makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Theresa May’s enemies are currently plotting? It may be
that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns, but the records of
which customers have purchased what.
Competition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power. But it is
clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow compared to the pace of change within the digital economy. By
the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace, to be
replaced by new abuses of power. But there is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as
presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the
users of these services don’t pay for them. The users of their services are not their customers. That
would be the people who buy advertising from them—and Facebook and Google， the two virtual
giants ， dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment
companies.
The product they’re selling is data， and we， the users， convert our lives to data for the benefit of
the digital giants.
Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew they produce when they feed, so
Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield. Ants keep predatory insects away from where
their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes. It doesn’t feel like a human or
democratic relationship， even if both sides benefit.

To combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy, Cal Newport, author of Deep work:
Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, recommends building a habit of “deep work”—the
ability to focus without distraction.
There are a number of approaches to mastering the art of deep work—be it lengthy retreats
dedicated to a specific task; developing a daily ritual; or taking a “journalistic” approach to seizing
moments of deep work when you can throughout the day. Whichever approach, the key is to
determine your length of focus time and stick to it.
360
Newport also recommends “deep scheduling” to combat constant interruptions and get more
done in less time.“At any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month.
Once on the calendar I protect this time like I would a doctor’s appointment or important meeting”,
he writes.
Another approach to getting more done in less time is to rethink how you prioritize your day—in
particular how we craft our to-do lists. Tim Harford, author of Messy: The Power of Disorder to
Transform Our Lives, points to a study in the early 1980s that divided undergraduates into two
groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan
activities and goals in much more detail, day by day.
While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when
it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students.
Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving
room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.
In order to make the most of our focus and energy. we also need to embrace downtime, or as
Newport suggests, “be lazy.”
“Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to be brain as
Vitamin D is to the body...[idleness]is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done,” he argues.
Srini Pillay, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes this
counter-intuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate
When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task, they tend to be more
efficient.
“What people don’t realise is that in order to complete these tasks they need to use both the focus
and unfocus circuits in their brain”. says Pillay.

Five ways to make conversation with anyone
Conversations are links, which means when you have a conversation with a new person a link
gets formed and every conversation you have after that moment will strengthen the link.
You meet new people every day: the grocery worker, the cab driver, new people at work or the
security guard at the door. Simply starting a conversation with them will form a link.
Here are five simple ways that you can make the first move and start a conversation with
strangers.

A fifth grader gets a homework assignment to select his future career path from a list of
occupations. He ticks “astronaut” but quickly adds “scientist” to the list and selects it as well. The
boy is convinced that if he reads enough. He can explore as many career paths as he likes. And so he
reads—everything from encyclopedias to science fiction novels. He reads so passionately that his
parents have to institute a “no reading policy” at the dinner table.
That boy was Bill Gates, and he hasn’t stopped reading yet—not even after becoming one of the
most successful people on the planet. Nowadays, his reading material has changed from science
fiction and reference books recently, he revealed that he reads at least 50 nonfiction books a year.
Gates chooses nonfiction title because they explain how the world works.“Each book opens up new
avenues of knowledge,” Gates says.

The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by
Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”， at Sotheby’s in London on September 15th 2008. All but two
pieces sold, fetching more than ￡ 70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer
called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.
The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its
peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research
firm—double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market
generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and
controversy in a way matched by few other industries.
In the weeks and months that followed Mr Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable,
especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the
financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries
and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector—for Chinese
contemporary art—they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two
biggest auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had
placed works for sale with them.
The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the
end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This
time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more
fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”
What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in
the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell.
Christie’s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was
interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack
of good work to sell. The three Ds—death, debt and divorce—still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone
who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.

I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room—a women's group that had invited men
to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and
anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that
women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He
gestured toward his wife and said, "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked
puzzled and hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work, I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep
the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."
This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public
situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.
The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler
Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed—but only a few of the
men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50
percent ， that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year —a virtual epidemic of failed
conversation.
In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible
inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than
their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking, social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused
on communication: "He doesn't listen to me." "He doesn't talk to me." I found as Hacker observed years before
that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this
expectation of their wives.
In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at
the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting
to talk.

Over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors — habits —
among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply
lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.
“There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers
only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private
industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”
The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to — Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever — had invested
hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce
new routines.
If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day — chewing gums, skin
moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth
whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins— are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly
brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many
Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or
one of the other brands.
A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started
bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long.
Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener
and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped
in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer
psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and
other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s
essential to making new products commercially viable.”
Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in
tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged,
controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy
foods.

Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the
principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on
juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no
citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that
defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community
and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than
representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing
representatives to govern for them.
But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states,
for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character.
Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection
as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries
provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first
served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for
jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to
have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at
home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of
democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and
required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975
decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all
parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to
be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became
president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting
much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation
committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year
Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.
Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made
their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the
chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice
based on having weathered their own crises.
The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than
64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one
proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers
concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise
departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%.
The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform
worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and
subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off
a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.
But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations
if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time
any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create
incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on
campus.

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened
to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco
Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America’s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about
how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them ? It will
hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.
In much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession.
Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global industry, have not only survived
but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.
It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society
of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer
products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures
have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.
Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and
advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues
came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD).
In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.
The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been
concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science
and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a
result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.

We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with
soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.
But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more.
During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination
with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.
Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase “less is more” was
actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated
with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II
and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on
the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies.
Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. Elegance,
he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and
laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s
sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big
and often empty.
The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, for example, were
smaller-two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along the city’s Gold
Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the
buildings’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.
The trend toward “less” was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more
modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading two-story ones he had designed
in the 1890s and the early 20th century.
The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture
magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic
effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everyday
life - few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers - but his belief that
self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.
